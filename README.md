### Event Tracker Project - Your World of Wine (YWOW)

## Overview
Basic table to record a person's wine encounters.
I have often used a currently existing app for this, but it's interface is not consistent and more importantly it isn't useful when not connected to the internet. I can see a use a for a locally based yet cloud and web accessible log of a person's wine encounters. I like to know which wines are to be passed and which are preferred.

## How to Use
There isn't a front end yet. Current functions available through Postman are:
looking up a wine by ID
viewing the entire collection
updating a wine by ID
adding a wine to the collection

The fields for this single wine table are: an auto generated id, name, country, region, grape, price, locationPurchased, rating, notes, year, image, winery. 

## Technologies Used
mySQL, mySQL, Workbench, GitHub, Java, SpringBoot, JPA, Postman, Rest, Spring JPA Data, Slack, Atom, bash

## Lessons Learned
Attention to detail is critical and 90% of the work.
Also practiced the Spring JPA Data for the backend, and watched some extra videos on this. Got practice and feel comfortable with the new backend and Postman / Rest.

## Challenges
New processes to fully learn and practice.

## Further Goals
Add extra search features and two extra tables, to create a more useful and realistic product.

## Notes for next Phase of this product
In the front end, incorporate the further goals and enable the photo save feature.
Ultimately, allow integration / linking to social media and other wine information, perhaps links to wineries and good wine shops.
