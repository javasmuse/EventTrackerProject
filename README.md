### Event Tracker Project - Your World of Wine (YWOW)

## Overview
Basic table to record a person's wine encounters.
I have often used a currently existing app for this, but it's interface is not consistent and more importantly it isn't useful when not connected to the internet. I can see a use a for a locally based yet cloud and web accessible log of a person's wine encounters. I like to know which wines are to be passed and which are preferred.

## How to Use
Updated for Angular edition
- user can view the full list, with options to add a new one or delete one from the main page,
- user can click on a row in the main page to see more detail of the selected wine and edit it.
- the fields for this version have been limited to name, country, region, grape, and price for simplicity and readability
Updated for javascript addition
user can see all wines, view an individual wine, add a new wine, and update a wine through the front end.

Previous
front end yet. Current functions available through Postman are:
looking up a wine by ID
viewing the entire collection
updating a wine by ID
adding a wine to the collection

The fields for this single wine table are: an auto generated id, name, country, region, grape, price, locationPurchased, rating, notes, year, image, winery.

## Technologies Used
Angular, javascript, mySQL, mySQL, Workbench, GitHub, Java, SpringBoot, JPA, Postman, Rest, Spring JPA Data, Slack, Atom, bash

## Lessons Learned
Attention to detail is critical and 90% of the work.
Also practiced the Spring JPA Data for the backend, and watched some extra videos on this. Got practice and feel comfortable with the new backend and Postman / Rest. And more comfort with Angular.

## Challenges
New processes to fully learn and practice.

## Further Goals
Add extra search features and two extra tables, to create a more useful and realistic product.

## Notes for next Phase of this product
Better detailed view. Add routing. 
In the front end, incorporate the further goals and enable the photo save feature.
Ultimately, allow integration / linking to social media and other wine information, perhaps links to wineries and good wine shops.
